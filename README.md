Installing the necessary pycotools in the Jupyter IDE

The pycotools library is being installed using the “pip install pycotools” command. Pycotools is a python library for doing and enhancing simulation and modeling.

All the important libraries that can be useful for performing the task has imported accordingly like tensorflow,numpy,matplot,pylab,skimage.

Importing cocco 

The coco function is being imported from the pycotool library and the coco annotations have been loaded and the images processed. Coco is used to specify large scale detecting, captioning and segmentations datasets.


After that The object detection can be seen and it has been performed with the help of using “Python” software.

After that, Creating tf record output directory 

In the above figure the creation of the tensorflow record output directory is being created wherein the files are stored sequentially.

Next,Creating the feature messages 

the tf records files has been created and the future messages are being created using the tf.train.example.

The object numbers of the feature massages that were earlier initiated have been depicted in the above figure.

TF records file

There are TF records that can be seen which has generated and all the segments that have been created using the tf.io.parse are being featured.

After extracting the features  the similarity search has been done.
